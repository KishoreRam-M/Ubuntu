        |-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
```

#### Show first-time fingerprint acceptance

When you connect to a new SSH server for the first time, its public key fingerprint is unknown to your client. SSH warns you about this to prevent Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks.

```bash
# Terminal Output (First-time connection)
$ ssh user@your_server_ip
The authenticity of host 'your_server_ip (your_server_ip)' can't be established.
ECDSA key fingerprint is SHA256:abc123def456...
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])? yes
Warning: Permanently added 'your_server_ip' (ECDSA) to the list of known hosts.
user@your_server_ip's password:
```

  * Typing `yes` adds the server's public key to your `~/.ssh/known_hosts` file, so future connections to that server won't prompt this warning unless the fingerprint changes (which could indicate a security issue).

#### Real use: Logging into cloud VMs (AWS EC2, Azure, DigitalOcean)

```asciiflow
+------------------------+
| Your Laptop/Workstation|
+------------------------+
      | ssh -i my-key.pem ubuntu@ec2-public-ip
      V
+------------------------------------------+
| Cloud Provider (AWS EC2, Azure VM, DO Droplet) |
|   +------------------------------------+   |
|   |         Linux VM instance          |   |
|   | (e.g., Ubuntu, CentOS)             |   |
|   |                                    |   |
|   | /home/ubuntu/.ssh/authorized_keys  |   |
|   +------------------------------------+   |
+------------------------------------------+
```

This is the fundamental way to manage virtual machines in any cloud environment.

### 2\. 🔑 Key-based Login (No password SSH)

Key-based authentication is the **gold standard for SSH security**. Instead of a password, it uses a pair of cryptographic keys: a public key and a private key.

#### Visual: SSH keypair generation via `ssh-keygen`

```asciiflow
+-------------------------+
|    Local Client PC      |
| +---------------------+ |
| |  ssh-keygen command | |
| +---------------------+ |
|           |             |
|           V             |
| +---------------------+ |
| | Private Key (Secret)| |  <-- id_rsa (NEVER SHARE!)
| | (~/.ssh/id_rsa)     | |
| +---------------------+ |
|           |             |
|           V             |
| +---------------------+ |
| | Public Key (Shareable)| | <-- id_rsa.pub (Distribute freely)
| | (~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub)   | |
| +---------------------+ |
+-------------------------+
```

```bash
# Terminal: Generating an SSH key pair
$ ssh-keygen
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (~/.ssh/id_rsa): # Press Enter for default
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): # (Optional, but recommended for security)
Enter same passphrase again:
Your identification has been saved in ~/.ssh/id_rsa
Your public key has been saved in ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
The key fingerprint is: ...
```

  * `id_rsa`: Your private key. Keep it secure and never share it.
  * `id_rsa.pub`: Your public key. This is what you put on remote servers.

#### Diagram: Public key ➜ Stored on remote, Private key ➜ Stored locally

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Local Client PC] --> B(Private Key: ~/.ssh/id_rsa)
    A --> C(Public Key: ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub)

    C -->|Copied To| D[Remote Linux Server]
    D --> E(Remote User's Home Directory: ~/.ssh/authorized_keys)

    F[SSH Connection Attempt] --> G{SSH Client presents Public Key request}
    G --> H[SSH Server checks authorized_keys]
    H -- Match Found --> I{SSH Server challenges Client to prove Private Key ownership}
    I --> J[SSH Client proves ownership using Private Key]
    J --> K[Secure Connection Established - No Password Needed!]
    K --> L[Access Granted]
```

#### Command: `ssh-copy-id user@server_ip`

This command simplifies the process of copying your public key to the remote server's `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file. It's the recommended way.

```bash
# Terminal: Copying Public Key
$ ssh-copy-id devops@your_server_ip
/usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: attempting to log in with the new key(s), to filter out any that are already installed
/usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: 1 key(s) remain to be installed -- if you are prompted now it is to install the new keys
devops@your_server_ip's password: # Enter the password for the REMOTE user
# Output will confirm key added
```

After this, you should be able to log in without a password:

```bash
$ ssh devops@your_server_ip
# No password prompt, directly logs in!
```

#### Use-case: Automation, secure CI/CD access, Git operations

  * **Automation:** Scripts can log into servers without hardcoding passwords.
  * **CI/CD:** Jenkins, GitLab CI, GitHub Actions use SSH keys to deploy code to servers without human intervention.
  * **Git:** Authenticating with GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket via SSH keys for secure `git push`/`pull` operations.

-----

**Interview Question:** How does key-based SSH login improve security over password-based login?

**Best Short-Form Answer:** Key-based SSH uses strong, complex cryptographic keys that are nearly impossible to guess or brute-force, unlike passwords. It eliminates the risk of weak passwords, phishing attacks, and credential stuffing, as the private key is never transmitted over the network.

### 3\. 📂 SCP: Secure Copy Protocol

SCP (Secure Copy Protocol) is a network protocol that supports file transfers between hosts on a network. It uses SSH for data transfer and authentication, ensuring confidentiality and integrity.

#### Visual: File transfer command flow

```asciiflow
+----------------+                         +---------------------+
|   Local PC     |                         |   Remote Server     |
|   /home/user   |                         |   /var/www/html     |
+-------+--------+                         +----------+----------+
        |                                             |
        |  1. From Local to Remote:                   |
        |     scp local_file.txt user@ip:/remote/path/ |
        V                                             V
  [local_file.txt] --------------------------------> [remote_file.txt]

        ^                                             ^
        |  2. From Remote to Local:                   |
        |     scp user@ip:/remote/file.txt ./local/path/ |
        +----------------------------------------------+
  [local_file.txt] <-------------------------------- [remote_file.txt]
```

  📦 (File/Dir)                           🗃️ (Storage)
```

#### Commands:

  * **From local to remote:**

    ```bash
    # Copy 'my_script.sh' from local current directory to remote user's home
    $ scp my_script.sh user@your_server_ip:~
    # Copy 'app_code/' directory recursively to /var/www/html on remote
    $ scp -r app_code/ user@your_server_ip:/var/www/html/
    ```

  * **From remote to local:**

    ```bash
    # Copy 'server_log.txt' from remote /var/log to local current directory
    $ scp user@your_server_ip:/var/log/server_log.txt .
    # Copy 'backups/' directory recursively from remote to local /tmp/
    $ scp -r user@your_server_ip:/mnt/backups/ /tmp/
    ```

      * **Note:** If using an SSH key for authentication, specify it with `-i`:
        `scp -i ~/.ssh/my_key.pem my_file.txt user@ip:/path/`

#### Use-case: Backing up files, transferring shell scripts, codebases

  * **Backups:** Periodically `scp` critical configuration files or databases from remote servers to a secure local or backup server.
  * **Script Deployment:** Quickly push automation scripts (e.g., a `cleanup.sh` script) to multiple servers.
  * **Code Deployment:** For smaller deployments or development environments, `scp` can transfer updated code to a web server.

-----

**Interview Question:** Difference between SCP, FTP, and SFTP?

**Best Short-Form Answer:**

  * **FTP (File Transfer Protocol):** Old, insecure, transfers data in plaintext. Rarely used in production for sensitive data.
  * **SCP (Secure Copy Protocol):** Builds on SSH, providing secure, authenticated, encrypted file transfers. Simple for basic copy operations.
  * **SFTP (SSH File Transfer Protocol):** Also builds on SSH, offering a more feature-rich file management protocol (like `ls`, `cd`, `mkdir`, `rm` remotely) while still being secure. It's often preferred for interactive graphical clients.

### 4\. 💻 Using PuTTY & WinSCP from Windows

For Windows users, PuTTY and WinSCP are indispensable tools for managing Linux VMs.

#### Diagram: SSH connection using **PuTTY**

PuTTY is a free and open-source terminal emulator, serial console and network file transfer application. It supports several network protocols, including SCP, SSH, Telnet, rlogin, and raw socket connection.

```asciiflow
+---------------------------------+
|          Your Windows PC        |
|  +---------------------------+  |
|  | PuTTY Configuration       |  |
|  |  - Host Name (IP/Hostname)|  |
|  |  - Port (22 default)      |  |
|  |  - Connection Type (SSH)  |  |
|  |  - Auth:                   |  |
|  |    - Username             |  |
|  |    - Password             |  |
|  |    - **Private Key (PPK)**|  |  <-- Converted from id_rsa.pem using PuTTYgen
|  +------------+--------------+  |
+----------------|----------------+
                 | SSH Tunnel (Encrypted)
                 V
+---------------------------------+
|        Remote Linux Server      |
|  +---------------------------+  |
|  | SSH Daemon (sshd)         |  |
|  | (Authorizes login)        |  |
|  +---------------------------+  |
+---------------------------------+
```

**Key Authentication (PPK):**

  * Windows SSH clients like PuTTY often use their own private key format (`.ppk`).
  * You'll need `PuTTYgen` (included with PuTTY) to convert an OpenSSH private key (`id_rsa` or `.pem`) into a `.ppk` file.
      * **Steps:** Load `id_rsa` in PuTTYgen -\> Save private key as `.ppk`.
  * In PuTTY, navigate to `Connection -> SSH -> Auth` and browse for your `.ppk` file.
  * **Save sessions:** In the PuTTY configuration window, after entering Hostname/IP, Port, and authentication details, go to `Session` in the left pane, give it a name (e.g., "My AWS Server"), and click "Save." This allows one-click connections later.

#### Visual: WinSCP Interface

WinSCP is a free SFTP, FTP, WebDAV, SCP client for Microsoft Windows. Its primary function is secure file transfer between a local and a remote computer.

```asciiflow
+-------------------------------------------------------------+
|                          WinSCP Interface                   |

| |  Session Manager                                        | |
| |  Host name: your_server_ip                              | |
| |  User name: devops                                      | |
| |  Password:  (Leave blank for key)                       | |
| |  Private key file: C:\Users\YourUser\.ssh\my_key.ppk    | |
| |  [ Login ] [ Save ] [ Cancel ]                          | |
| +---------------------------------------------------------+ |
| +-------------------------+   +-------------------------+ |
| |   Local Pane (Windows)  |   |   Remote Pane (Linux)   | |
| | +---------------------+ |   | +---------------------+ | |
| | | C:\my_project_code  | |   | | /var/www/html/app   | | |
| | | - index.html        | |   | | - index.html        | | |
| | | - styles.css        | |   | | - styles.css        | | |
| | +---------------------+ |   | +---------------------+ | |
| +-----------+-------------+   +-------------+-----------+ |
|             | Drag-and-Drop / Sync Files    |             |
|             +-------------------------------+             |
+-------------------------------------------------------------+
```

  * **Drag-and-drop GUI:** Easily transfer files by dragging them between the local and remote panes.
  * **Secure file sync:** WinSCP offers powerful synchronization features, allowing you to keep local and remote directories in sync.
  * **Integration with PuTTY:** You can launch a PuTTY session directly from WinSCP for the current server.

#### Highlight: Best combo for Windows users to manage Linux VMs

**PuTTY (for terminal access) + WinSCP (for GUI file transfers)** is the de facto standard and highly recommended combination for Windows users managing Linux servers. It covers both command-line control and intuitive file management.

### 5\. 🪟 Remote Access via WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)

WSL allows developers to run a GNU/Linux environment -- including most command-line tools, utilities, and applications -- directly on Windows, unmodified, without the overhead of a traditional virtual machine or dual-boot setup.

#### Diagram: WSL architecture — Windows kernel vs Linux kernel

```mermaid

    style D fill:#a7e6b3,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style E fill:#f0f0f0,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
```

  * **Traditional VM:** Linux kernel runs entirely on a hypervisor.
  * **WSL:** Linux binaries run directly on Windows, with a lightweight Linux kernel interface translating Linux system calls to the Windows kernel. This provides near-native performance.

#### Show: Opening Ubuntu (WSL) ➜ Using `ssh`, `scp`, `rsync` inside

```asciiflow

| | Start Menu -> Type "Ubuntu" -> Click    | |
| +-----------------------------------------+ |
|         |                                   |
|         V                                   |
| +-----------------------------------------+ |
| |     Ubuntu (WSL) Terminal Window        | |
| |                                         | |
| | $ ssh devops@your_server_ip             | |  <-- Native Linux SSH client
| | Password:                               | |
| | Last login: ...                         | |
| | devops@remote-server:~ $                | |
| |                                         | |
| | $ scp my_local_script.sh devops@your_server_ip:/tmp/ |  <-- Native Linux SCP
| |                                         | |
| | $ rsync -avz /local/data/ devops@your_server_ip:/remote/data/ | <-- Native Linux Rsync
| +-----------------------------------------+ |
+---------------------------------------------+
```

  * The beauty of WSL is that you get a full Linux command-line environment directly within Windows, allowing you to use all standard Linux tools like `ssh`, `scp`, `rsync`, `git`, `curl`, etc., without needing PuTTY or WinSCP.

#### Visual: WSL vs PuTTY vs VirtualBox comparison table

| Feature         | WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)        | PuTTY (Windows Native)                | VirtualBox (Traditional VM)          |
| :-------------- | :--------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------ | :----------------------------------- |
| **Linux Env** | Full Linux CLI experience (no GUI)       | Just an SSH client (no local Linux)   | Full Linux OS (CLI + GUI)            |
| **Resource Use**| Lightweight, low overhead                | Minimal, just a terminal app          | High, full OS emulation              |
| **Integration** | Excellent with Windows filesystem        | Remote-only                           | Isolated from Windows by default     |
| **Setup Ease** | Very easy (single command/store install) | Easy (small executable download)      | Moderate (OS installation + config)  |
| **Use Case** | Linux CLI tools on Windows, scripting    | Remote server terminal access         | Running full desktop Linux OS        |
| **SSH/SCP** | Native Linux commands                    | Needs PuTTY/WinSCP/VS Code for SSH/SCP | Native Linux commands                |

#### Bonus: Using VS Code Remote – WSL extension

VS Code (Visual Studio Code) with its Remote - WSL extension provides an incredibly powerful development experience.

```asciiflow
+-------------------------------------------------+
|             Visual Studio Code on Windows       |

| |  > /mnt/c/my_windows_project/               | |
| |  > /home/wsl_user/my_linux_project/         | |
| |                                             | |
| |  +---------------------------------------+  |
| |  |  VS Code integrated terminal (WSL)    |  |
| |  |  $ ssh user@remote_server             |  |
| |  |  $ git clone ...                      |  |
| |  +---------------------------------------+  |
| |                                             | |
| +---------------------------------------------+ |
+-------------------------------------------------+

  * You can open any folder (Windows or Linux filesystem) directly within WSL using VS Code.
  * The integrated terminal within VS Code effectively becomes your WSL terminal, giving you direct access to `ssh`, `scp`, `git`, and other Linux command-line tools from a familiar editor environment. This is a game-changer for cross-platform development.

## 🧠 Interview Questions

1.  **How does key-based SSH login improve security over password-based login?**
    (Already answered above in section 2)

2.  **What happens during an SSH handshake?**
    **Best Short-Form Answer:** The SSH handshake establishes a secure, encrypted connection. It involves:

    1.  **Negotiation:** Client and server agree on encryption algorithms.
    2.  **Key Exchange:** They securely exchange session keys.
    3.  **Server Authentication:** The client verifies the server's identity (first-time fingerprint or `known_hosts`).
    4.  **User Authentication:** The user authenticates to the server (password or public key).
        Only after successful authentication and secure tunnel establishment is the shell session or file transfer initiated.

3.  **Difference between SCP, FTP, and SFTP?**
    (Already answered above in section 3)

4.  **How do you troubleshoot "Permission denied (publickey)" error?**
    **Best Short-Form Answer:** This error usually means the server couldn't authenticate you with your provided SSH key. Common causes and troubleshooting steps:

      * **Public key not on server:** Ensure your public key (`.pub`) is correctly added to `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` on the remote server.
      * **Incorrect permissions:** `.ssh` directory on the server should be `700`, `authorized_keys` file `600`.
      * **Wrong key specified:** Ensure you're using `ssh -i /path/to/private_key` if it's not `id_rsa`.
      * **Incorrect username:** Verify the `user@ip` is correct.
      * **Private key permissions (local):** Your local private key (`id_rsa` or `.pem`) should have `400` or `600` permissions.
      * **Agent forwarding:** Ensure `ssh-agent` is running and your key is added to it (`ssh-add`).

5.  **Real-world: Automate file deployment using `scp` in a script?**
    **Best Short-Form Answer:** You can embed `scp` commands directly into shell scripts. Ensure you use SSH keys for authentication, as passwords cannot be reliably automated in scripts without security risks.

    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash
    # deploy_app.sh

    REMOTE_USER="ubuntu"
    REMOTE_IP="your_ec2_ip"
    REMOTE_PATH="/var/www/html/"
    LOCAL_APP_DIR="./dist/" # Your compiled application files
    SSH_KEY="~/.ssh/my_web_deploy_key.pem"

    echo "--- Deploying application to $REMOTE_IP ---"

    # Check if local directory exists
    if [ ! -d "$LOCAL_APP_DIR" ]; then
        echo "Error: Local application directory '$LOCAL_APP_DIR' not found."
        exit 1
    fi

    # Use scp for recursive copy, with key-based authentication
    scp -i "$SSH_KEY" -r "$LOCAL_APP_DIR"* "$REMOTE_USER"@"$REMOTE_IP":"$REMOTE_PATH"

    if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
        echo "Deployment successful!"
        echo "Restarting web service on remote server..."
        # You can execute commands remotely via ssh
        ssh -i "$SSH_KEY" "$REMOTE_USER"@"$REMOTE_IP" "sudo systemctl restart nginx"
        if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
            echo "Web service restarted successfully."
        else
            echo "Failed to restart web service."
        fi
    else
        echo "Deployment failed!"
        exit 1
    fi
    ```

## 🧰 Bonus Real-World Scenarios

  * ### 🔄 Push shell script to AWS EC2 using SCP

    ```bash
    # Local terminal
    $ scp -i ~/.ssh/my_aws_key.pem my_script.sh ubuntu@ec2-1-2-3-4.compute-1.amazonaws.com:~
    ```

      * This copies `my_script.sh` to the `ubuntu` user's home directory on your EC2 instance.
      * You can then SSH in and run it: `ssh -i ~/.ssh/my_aws_key.pem ubuntu@ec2-1-2-3-4.compute-1.amazonaws.com 'bash ~/my_script.sh'`

  * ### 🔒 Secure a server using only key-based login (`PasswordAuthentication no`)

    **Steps:**

    1.  Ensure you have established key-based login successfully (using `ssh-copy-id`).
    2.  SSH into your remote server.
    3.  Edit the SSH daemon configuration file:
        ```bash
        sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
        ```
    4.  Find and change/add these lines:
        ```
        PasswordAuthentication no
        PubkeyAuthentication yes
        ChallengeResponseAuthentication no # Good practice to disable
        UsePAM no # Good practice to disable if not needed
        ```
    5.  Save and exit.
    6.  **Crucially, start a NEW terminal and test if you can still SSH in with your key.**
    7.  If successful, restart the SSH service:
        ```bash
        sudo systemctl restart sshd
        ```

    <!-- end list -->

      * This hardens your server against password-based brute-force attacks.

  * ### 🔧 Transfer logs from remote server to local disk for analysis

    ```bash
    # Local terminal
    # Create a local directory for logs
    $ mkdir -p ~/server_logs/my_app/

    # Copy all log files from remote /var/log/myapp/ to local directory
    $ scp -i ~/.ssh/dev_server_key.pem user@dev_server_ip:/var/log/myapp/*.log ~/server_logs/my_app/

    # After transfer, analyze locally with grep, awk, etc.
    $ grep "ERROR" ~/server_logs/my_app/app.log
    ```

  * ### 🗃️ Scheduled file sync between Linux and Windows (WinSCP task)

    WinSCP can be automated using its scripting capabilities or command-line interface. You can integrate this with Windows Task Scheduler.

    **Example WinSCP Script (`sync_website.txt`):**

    ```
    # Connect to remote server
    open sftp://user:password@your_server_ip -hostkey="ssh-rsa 2048 XXXXXXXXX..." -privatekey="C:\path\to\your\key.ppk"
    # Or, if session saved in WinSCP GUI:
    # open my_saved_session

    # Synchronize remote 'production_website_root' with local 'C:\dev\website\'
    synchronize remote -delete C:\dev\website\ /var/www/html/

    # Close connection
    close
    exit
    ```

    **Run this script from Windows Command Prompt/PowerShell:**

    ```cmd
    "C:\Program Files (x86)\WinSCP\WinSCP.com" /script="C:\path\to\sync_website.txt" /log="C:\path\to\winscp.log"
    ```

    This command can then be scheduled via Windows Task Scheduler to run at specific intervals, ensuring your local code is always synced with the production server or vice-versa
